  "juzSummary": "Juz 4 delivers some of the Quran's most powerful lessons on sacrifice, community, and perseverance. The continuation of Aal-Imran gives us the detailed account of the Battle of Uhud — a defining moment where the Muslim community learned that even with the Prophet (ﷺ) among them, shortcuts and disobedience have consequences. The Juz then transitions into An-Nisa (The Women), which opens with a declaration of human equality rooted in a single origin, before laying down foundational laws for protecting the vulnerable: orphans, women, and families. Together, these passages teach that true righteousness requires both personal sacrifice and just treatment of others.",

The 'rope of Allah' is the Quran and the deen itself. When Muslims let go of this rope and grab onto tribalism or partisanship instead, the consequences are exactly what we see in the Ummah today."

  "connectingTheDots": "Aal-Imran ends by teaching the Muslim community how to survive external threats through unity, patience, and reliance on Allah. An-Nisa then turns inward, addressing the internal threats to a community — injustice within families, exploitation of the weak, and disputes over wealth. The transition is deliberate: a community that just lost men at Uhud now needs laws to protect the widows and orphans left behind. External strength means nothing without internal justice.",

    {
      "name": "Sacrifice and True Righteousness",
      "explanation": "Juz 4 opens with a defining statement: 'You will never attain righteousness until you spend from what you love' (3:92). This theme echoes through Uhud, where the Companions sacrificed their lives, and into An-Nisa, where believers are asked to sacrifice their greed to protect orphans and give women their rightful inheritance.",
      "dailyRelevance": "During Ramadan, fasting teaches sacrifice through hunger and thirst. But the deeper sacrifice is giving from what you love — your time, your money, your comfort. Today, identify one thing you love that you can give for Allah's sake, whether it's a generous sadaqah or time spent serving someone in need."

    {
      "name": "Lessons from Defeat",
      "explanation": "The Battle of Uhud is a masterclass in how Allah teaches through failure. The Muslims initially won, then lost because the archers abandoned their positions for worldly spoils (3:152). Allah did not abandon the believers — He used defeat to purify, teach, and strengthen them (3:140-142).",
      "dailyRelevance": "We all face setbacks — a broken habit streak, a missed prayer, a moment of weakness in Ramadan. Uhud teaches us that failure is not the end; it's a teacher. What matters is whether you get back up and learn the lesson. Don't let one bad day ruin your entire Ramadan."

    {
      "name": "Protecting the Vulnerable",
      "explanation": "An-Nisa opens with urgent protections for those who cannot protect themselves: orphans whose wealth is consumed, women denied inheritance, and families torn apart by greed. Islam's legal framework is built on the principle that the strong must actively safeguard the weak.",
      "dailyRelevance": "Ramadan heightens our empathy through fasting. Use that empathy practically: check on a widow in your community, sponsor an orphan, or ensure that any inheritance or financial matters in your family are handled justly according to Islamic principles."

  "hadithOfTheDay": {
    "text": "The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'The believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other.' The Prophet (ﷺ) then clasped his hands with the fingers interlaced.",
    "source": "Sahih al-Bukhari #6026, Sahih Muslim #2585",
    "reflection": "This hadith perfectly captures the spirit of Juz 4. After Uhud, the Muslim community learned that individual heroism means nothing without collective discipline. Just as the archers' abandonment of their post affected everyone, your role in the community matters. In Ramadan, be the brick that strengthens the building — support your family, check on your neighbors, and pray in congregation."

  "dailyPractice": "Today, act on verse 3:92 — give away something you genuinely love. It could be money you were saving for yourself, time you planned to spend on leisure, or even your favorite food at iftar shared with a neighbor. The key is that it should cost you something emotionally, not just financially. When Abu Talhah heard this verse, he gave away his most prized garden. You don't need to match that — but push past your comfort zone and feel the weight of real generosity.",
  "discussionQuestions": {
    "reflectionQuestion": "The Battle of Uhud shows that the Muslims lost their advantage when the archers left their posts to collect war spoils (3:152). Where in your own life have short-term desires caused you to abandon a long-term position that was protecting you — whether in your faith, relationships, or goals?",
    "applicationQuestion": "An-Nisa 4:2-6 commands the protection of orphans' rights and wealth. Beyond orphans specifically, who are the vulnerable people in your circle — elderly parents, struggling neighbors, underpaid workers — and what is one concrete step you can take this week to stand up for their rights?"
  },
  "habitCheckIn": "Day 4 — By now your Ramadan rhythm should be forming. How is your Quran reading going? Are you just reciting, or are you pausing to understand? Today's Juz is heavy with lessons from Uhud and family law — both require reflection, not speed. If you've been rushing through pages, slow down. Read fewer verses with more thought. Quality over quantity will transform your relationship with the Quran this month.",
  "closingMessage": "Juz 4 doesn't let us off easy. It asks us to give from what we love, to learn from painful defeat, to protect those who cannot protect themselves, and to remember that every soul — including ours — will taste death. But it also reminds us that Allah never wastes the effort of any worker among us (3:195), male or female. Your sacrifices are seen. Your struggles count. Keep going.",
