  "juzSummary": "Juz 10 continues the lessons of Badr from Al-Anfal and then transitions into At-Tawbah \u2014 the only Surah in the Quran that begins without Bismillah, signaling the severity of its themes. Al-Anfal's final portion establishes rules for distribution of war gains, the significance of divine support at Badr, and the bonds of the believing community. At-Tawbah then delivers the Quran's most uncompromising call to accountability: a declaration of disavowal from those who broke their treaties, exposure of hypocrites who refused to join the Tabuk expedition, and a clear distinction between sincere believers and those who use faith as a mask. Together, these passages force us to confront a difficult question: is our commitment to Allah conditional, or are we willing to sacrifice when it truly costs us something?",

The transition from Badr's triumph to Tabuk's test of loyalty is a warning that faith is not proven in one glorious moment but in the daily, unglamorous choice to show up when it costs you something.",

      "explanation": "At-Tawbah is the Quran's most detailed exposure of hypocrisy \u2014 not just denial of faith, but the subtle disease of saying one thing and doing another, of performing religion publicly while the heart is absent. The hypocrites at Tabuk swore oaths and made excuses, claiming they would have joined if they could (9:42-48), while secretly rejoicing at staying behind.",
      "dailyRelevance": "During Ramadan, we fast publicly and pray in congregation \u2014 but how much of it is truly for Allah? Use this Juz as a mirror. Where in your life are you performing faith without feeling it? The goal is not guilt but honest self-awareness that leads to genuine change."

What you do with your money reveals what you truly worship. The hypocrites clung to their wealth; the sincere believers gave freely.",
      "dailyRelevance": "Ramadan is the month of generosity. This Juz challenges you to examine your relationship with money \u2014 are you giving sadaqah consistently, or is your charity limited to when it is convenient?

      "paragraphs": [
        "In the ninth year after the Hijrah, news reached Madinah that the Byzantine Empire was amassing forces along the northern border of the Arabian Peninsula. The Prophet (\ufdfa) made a rare decision: he openly announced the destination and called for a full mobilization. This was unusual \u2014 in most campaigns, the target was kept secret. But Tabuk was different. It was far, it was summer, the harvest was ripe, and the heat was brutal. Allah wanted to expose who would sacrifice and who would make excuses.",
        "The response revealed the true state of the community. The sincere believers gave everything they had. Abu Bakr (RA) brought his entire wealth. Umar (RA) brought half of his. Uthman (RA) financed a massive portion of the army. Poor companions who could not afford mounts came to the Prophet weeping, asking to be taken along, and he had to turn them away because there were not enough riding animals. The Quran immortalizes them: 'Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you to be carried, you said, \"I cannot find anything for you to ride upon,\" and they turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears' (9:92).",
        "But others within the community \u2014 the hypocrites \u2014 found every excuse not to go. Some claimed the heat was too severe. Others said their farms needed them. Some even said, 'Do not go out in the heat,' to which Allah responded: 'Say, the fire of Hell is more intense in heat, if they only understood' (9:81). The expedition became a sieve: it separated those whose faith was real from those who performed religion only when it was convenient.",
        "The army marched to Tabuk and found that the Byzantine forces had retreated. There was no battle. But that was not the point. The point was the journey itself \u2014 the willingness to leave comfort behind when Allah called. Those who went were honored, and those who stayed were exposed. Three sincere believers who stayed behind without valid excuse were subjected to fifty days of social isolation before Allah accepted their repentance \u2014 a story told later in At-Tawbah (9:118).",

        "The continuation of Surah Al-Anfal in this Juz reveals the intricate ways Allah orchestrated the Muslim victory at Badr \u2014 not just through angelic reinforcement, but through a series of subtle, invisible interventions that tilted every factor in the believers' favor. The Quran does not present Badr as a story of human bravery alone. It insists that behind every visible action was an unseen divine Hand.",
        "The night before the battle, Allah cast a deep, peaceful sleep over the Muslim camp (8:11). Soldiers facing a force three times their size should have been anxious, restless, unable to close their eyes. Instead, they slept soundly and woke refreshed. Then Allah sent rain \u2014 enough to firm the sandy ground beneath the Muslims' feet and make it muddy and slippery for the approaching Quraysh (8:11). The battlefield itself was being prepared by its Creator.",
        "Perhaps the most remarkable divine intervention was perceptual. Allah made each army appear smaller to the other (8:43-44). The Muslims saw the Quraysh as fewer, giving them courage to advance. The Quraysh saw the Muslims as fewer, making them overconfident and careless. Both sides acted on what they saw, but what they saw was shaped by Allah. The verse concludes: 'And to Allah are [all] matters returned' (8:44) \u2014 a reminder that even our perceptions are under His control.",
        "After the victory, Allah delivered the most humbling statement possible: 'You did not kill them, but it was Allah who killed them. And you threw not when you threw, but it was Allah who threw' (8:17). The Prophet (\ufdfa) had thrown a handful of dust toward the enemy during the battle, and Allah turned it into a force that reached every opponent's eyes. But the deeper meaning is universal: every effort you make, every result you achieve, ultimately flows through Allah's power, not your own."

        "Among the most striking revelations in At-Tawbah is the story of Masjid Ad-Dirar \u2014 a mosque built by hypocrites in Madinah not for worship, but to divide the Muslim community. On the surface, it looked like any other mosque: a building dedicated to prayer. But its founders had a hidden purpose. They built it to serve as a meeting point for those who opposed the Prophet (\ufdfa) from within, and as a base for Abu Amir Ar-Rahib, a man who had openly allied with the Quraysh and later the Byzantines against the Muslims.",
        "The hypocrites came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) before the Tabuk expedition and asked him to pray in their new mosque, hoping that his prayer there would legitimize it. The Prophet deferred, saying he would visit after returning from the campaign. But before he could, Allah revealed the truth: 'And [there are] those who took for themselves a mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against Allah and His Messenger before' (9:107).",
        "Allah commanded the Prophet (\ufdfa) never to pray in it. Instead, He directed him to the mosque that was 'founded on righteousness from the first day' \u2014 Masjid Quba, which the Prophet himself had established during the Hijrah. The message was unmistakable: the value of a place of worship is not in its walls but in the intention behind it. A mosque built on sincerity, even if simple, is more beloved to Allah than an elaborate structure built on hypocrisy.",
        "The Prophet (\ufdfa) ordered Masjid Ad-Dirar to be demolished and burned. It was a profound act \u2014 destroying a building that outwardly looked like a mosque \u2014 because it taught the community that labels do not determine reality. Something can bear the name of worship while its essence is corruption. This story is not just about a building in 7th-century Madinah. It is about every act of worship, charity, or service that is performed for show, reputation, or ulterior motives."
