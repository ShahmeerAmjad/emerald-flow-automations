  "specialMessage": "Welcome to a journey that could change everything.\n\nFor the next 30 days, you and the Quran are going to sit together — not as a chore, not as a ritual you rush through, but as a conversation between your soul and the One who shaped it. Allah says, 'I am near' (2:186). This month, we test that promise. We show up, and we see what happens when we actually listen.\n\nHere's how this works. Each day, we walk through one Juz — its themes, its standout verses, the stories buried inside it that were always meant for you. You'll find reflections that connect ancient wisdom to the life you're living right now. You'll find a daily practice — something small, something real — designed to help you leave one habit behind or build one that lasts beyond Ramadan.\n\nThis isn't about perfection. It's about presence. Some days you'll feel the words hit your chest like they were written for you. Other days you'll struggle to focus. Both are part of the journey. The Quran meets you where you are.\n\nThink of this as 30 letters from your Creator, arriving one per day. Each one says the same thing underneath all the stories and laws and parables: I made you. I know you. Come back to Me.\n\nLet's begin.",
  "juzSummary": "Juz 1 opens the Quran with Al-Fatihah — the essential prayer that every Muslim recites daily — then launches into the beginning of Al-Baqarah, the longest Surah in the Quran. Together, they set the foundation: Al-Fatihah teaches us HOW to ask Allah for guidance, and Al-Baqarah begins answering that request by describing what guidance looks like. We meet three types of people (believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites), revisit the story of Adam's creation, and learn from the detailed history of the Children of Israel — their blessings, their mistakes, and the lessons we should take from them.",

        "The du'a for guidance ('Guide us to the straight path') is the most repeated prayer in Islam — you say it at least 17 times daily in your obligatory prayers. Let that sink in: guidance is your number one need."

      "dailyRelevance": "In Ramadan, it's easy to go through the motions — fasting, praying, reading — without heart engagement. Before each act of worship today, pause and renew your intention sincerely."
