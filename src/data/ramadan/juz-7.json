  "juzSummary": "Juz 7 bridges the end of Al-Ma'idah and the beginning of Al-An'am, transitioning from the last Madani legislation to the powerful Makkan call to monotheism. Al-Ma'idah closes with profound stories \u2014 the disciples asking Isa (AS) for a heavenly table, Isa denying he ever told people to worship him or his mother, and critical rulings on intoxicants, oaths, and hunting during pilgrimage. Then Al-An'am opens with a thundering declaration of Allah's sovereignty over creation, Ibrahim's rational journey to find God, and a roster of eighteen prophets whose way we are told to follow. The overarching message is clear: worship Allah alone, follow His messengers sincerely, and do not let worldly distractions or false gods divert you from the truth.",

        "On the Day of Judgment, Allah will ask Isa directly: 'Did you tell people to take you and your mother as gods?' and Isa will deny it completely (5:116-117), clarifying his true message was pure Tawheed."

Ibrahim's famous rejection of celestial bodies as gods (6:76-79) demonstrates that reason itself leads to monotheism.",
      "dailyRelevance": "In Ramadan, examine your own subtle forms of 'shirk' \u2014 not idol worship, but placing excessive dependence on wealth, status, people, or your own abilities instead of Allah. Today, consciously redirect your trust and reliance back to Allah alone in at least one area of your life."

      "name": "Accountability and Divine Knowledge",
      "explanation": "From the oaths and rulings in Al-Ma'idah to the 'not a leaf falls' verse in Al-An'am, this Juz emphasizes that nothing escapes Allah's awareness. Every word we speak, every commitment we make, and every secret we harbor is known to Him. The Day of Judgment scenes \u2014 where even prophets will be questioned \u2014 underscore that accountability is universal.",
      "dailyRelevance": "Fasting trains us in exactly this awareness: no one sees you when you're alone, yet you refrain from food and drink because Allah sees. Carry that same consciousness into your speech, your screen time, and your private thoughts today."
    },
    {
      "name": "Respecting Boundaries",
      "explanation": "Al-Ma'idah addresses specific boundaries: don't prohibit what Allah made lawful (5:87), don't consume intoxicants or gamble (5:90-91), observe hunting restrictions during ihram (5:94-96), and don't pry into matters that may distress you (5:101). Al-An'am adds: don't insult what others worship (6:108). Islam is precise about its limits, and wisdom lies in observing them.",
      "dailyRelevance": "During Ramadan, we're already practicing boundary-keeping by controlling what enters our bodies. Extend that to what exits your mouth \u2014 avoid harsh words, unnecessary debates, and insults, even toward those you disagree with."

        "The disciples of Isa (AS) came to him one day with an extraordinary request. They said, 'O Isa, son of Maryam, can your Lord send down to us a table spread with food from heaven?' It was not that they doubted Allah's power \u2014 they wanted their hearts to be at rest, to witness a sign with their own eyes, and to be among those who could testify to it. Isa (AS) cautioned them first: 'Fear Allah, if you should be believers.' But they persisted.",
        "Isa (AS) then raised his hands and called upon Allah: 'O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table spread from heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, and You are the best of providers.' It was a prayer of humility and purpose \u2014 not asking for a spectacle, but for a sign that would mark a celebration for his community and strengthen their conviction.",
        "Allah answered the prayer, but with a solemn warning: 'Indeed, I will send it down to you, but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you \u2014 then indeed will I punish him with a punishment by which I have not punished anyone among the worlds.' The table descended from heaven, a miracle witnessed by the disciples. It was a moment of overwhelming awe and gratitude.",
        "The story carries a profound lesson that echoes across time. Miracles do not guarantee faith. The very people who received this sign were warned that disbelief after witnessing it would bring the harshest of consequences. In our own lives, we often ask Allah for signs \u2014 show me and I'll believe, give me this and I'll be grateful. But the question is never whether Allah can provide. The question is whether we will remain faithful after He does."

        "Ibrahim (AS) grew up in a society steeped in idol worship. His father Azar was himself a maker of idols. But Ibrahim carried within him a restless intellect and a heart that could not settle for inherited falsehood. Allah describes his journey to truth not as blind acceptance, but as a rational search \u2014 and it begins with him looking at the sky.",
        "When night fell and Ibrahim saw a star, he said, 'This is my lord.' But when the star set and disappeared below the horizon, he said, 'I do not like those that set.' He was testing each celestial body against the criteria of what a true god must be: permanent, self-sufficient, and unchanging. When the moon rose in all its brilliance, he said, 'This is my lord.' But it too set, and Ibrahim declared, 'Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among the people gone astray.'",
        "Then the sun rose \u2014 the most magnificent object in the sky, the source of light and life. Ibrahim said, 'This is my lord; this is greater.' But when even the mighty sun set, Ibrahim reached his conclusion with absolute clarity: 'O my people, indeed I am free from what you associate with Allah. Indeed, I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth, and I am not of those who associate others with Allah.'",
        "What makes Ibrahim's story extraordinary is that Allah presents it as a model of how reason leads to faith. Ibrahim did not need a book or a prophet to arrive at monotheism \u2014 he observed the natural world and followed the logic to its conclusion. Anything that sets, changes, or depends on something else cannot be God. Only the One who created it all \u2014 who is beyond setting, beyond change, beyond need \u2014 deserves worship. This is the fitrah (natural disposition) that every human being carries."

You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.' He does not defend himself with arguments or excuses.
