  "juzSummary": "Juz 7 bridges the end of Al-Ma'idah and the beginning of Al-An'am, transitioning from the last Madani legislation to the powerful Makkan call to monotheism. Al-Ma'idah closes with profound stories \u2014 the disciples asking Isa (AS) for a heavenly table, Isa denying he ever told people to worship him or his mother, and critical rulings on intoxicants, oaths, and hunting during pilgrimage. Then Al-An'am opens with a thundering declaration of Allah's sovereignty over creation, Ibrahim's rational journey to find God, and a roster of eighteen prophets whose way we are told to follow. The overarching message is clear: worship Allah alone, follow His messengers sincerely, and do not let worldly distractions or false gods divert you from the truth.",

Ibrahim's famous rejection of celestial bodies as gods (6:76-79) demonstrates that reason itself leads to monotheism.",
      "dailyRelevance": "In Ramadan, examine your own subtle forms of 'shirk' \u2014 not idol worship, but placing excessive dependence on wealth, status, people, or your own abilities instead of Allah. Today, consciously redirect your trust and reliance back to Allah alone in at least one area of your life."

    {
      "name": "Accountability and Divine Knowledge",
      "explanation": "From the oaths and rulings in Al-Ma'idah to the 'not a leaf falls' verse in Al-An'am, this Juz emphasizes that nothing escapes Allah's awareness. Every word we speak, every commitment we make, and every secret we harbor is known to Him. The Day of Judgment scenes \u2014 where even prophets will be questioned \u2014 underscore that accountability is universal.",
      "dailyRelevance": "Fasting trains us in exactly this awareness: no one sees you when you're alone, yet you refrain from food and drink because Allah sees. Carry that same consciousness into your speech, your screen time, and your private thoughts today."
    },
    {
      "name": "Respecting Boundaries",
      "explanation": "Al-Ma'idah addresses specific boundaries: don't prohibit what Allah made lawful (5:87), don't consume intoxicants or gamble (5:90-91), observe hunting restrictions during ihram (5:94-96), and don't pry into matters that may distress you (5:101). Al-An'am adds: don't insult what others worship (6:108). Islam is precise about its limits, and wisdom lies in observing them.",
      "dailyRelevance": "During Ramadan, we're already practicing boundary-keeping by controlling what enters our bodies. Extend that to what exits your mouth \u2014 avoid harsh words, unnecessary debates, and insults, even toward those you disagree with."

    "text": "The Messenger of Allah (\uFDFA) said: 'Every intoxicant is khamr, and every intoxicant is haram (forbidden).'",
    "source": "Sahih Muslim #2003",
    "reflection": "Connecting directly to Al-Ma'idah 5:90-91, this hadith broadens the prohibition beyond just wine to every substance that intoxicates. In Ramadan, we're already abstaining from food and drink during the day \u2014 use this momentum to evaluate any habit that clouds your judgment or distances you from Allah, whether it's a substance, an addiction to screens, or anything that intoxicates your attention."

  "dailyPractice": "Today, practice Ibrahim's method from 6:76-79. Before Maghrib, step outside and look at the sky \u2014 the sun setting, the first stars appearing. Instead of scrolling through your phone, spend five minutes observing creation and reflecting: this beauty didn't create itself, and it doesn't sustain itself. Let the natural world point you toward its Creator, just as it pointed Ibrahim. Then make your Maghrib prayer with that renewed sense of awe.",
  "discussionQuestions": {
    "reflectionQuestion": "In 5:116-117, Isa (AS) will stand before Allah and say he only taught what he was commanded. If you were asked by Allah what you taught the people in your circle of influence \u2014 your family, your friends, your colleagues \u2014 what would your answer be? Are you modeling the message you claim to believe in?",
    "applicationQuestion": "Al-An'am 6:108 tells us not to insult what others worship, even though we disagree. Think about a recent conversation where you discussed religion or values with someone who sees things differently. Did you speak in a way that opened a door or closed one? What is one specific way you can improve your approach this week?"

  "habitCheckIn": "Day 7 \u2014 you've completed a full week of this journey. By now, you should have a rhythm: reading, reflecting, praying. If you've missed a day or two, don't let that discourage you \u2014 pick up right here. Today, check in on one specific habit: are you making du'a at iftar time? The Prophet (\uFDFA) told us the fasting person has a supplication that is not rejected. Don't waste this window. Have a list of three du'as ready before you break your fast tonight.",
  "closingMessage": "One full week in. You've journeyed from Al-Fatihah's prayer for guidance all the way through the legislative foundation of Al-Ma'idah and into the theological powerhouse of Al-An'am. Ibrahim looked at the stars and found Allah. The disciples asked for a table from heaven and received it. You're reading the same Book that guided them all. Keep going \u2014 the best is yet to come.",
